## Background
This project is the product of DeisHacks, a 48 hour hackathon for social good. We chose to work with the Waltham Chamber of Commerce, an organization that supports and advocates for local businesses. Our primary goal coming into this hackathon was to develop a solution to efficiently connect local for-profit and non-profit businesses. 

## Implementation
We used the MERN stack (minus MongoDB due to time constrains) to create our website. 

## Purpose

This is an implementation of matching nonprofits and for-profits. Once for-profits match with the non-profit, they would be added to a forum hosted by a non-profit to communicate. This is implement in ___ different forms: mernstack, typescript.
